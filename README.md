Binding affinity can indicate the effectiveness of the specific medication and the specific protein. However, this value is influenced by many intermolucular interaction.
The problem is this project is to find a binding affinity between protein and ligand. We proporsed a new way to processing the input from three dimentional image to two dimentional image and implemeented a simple deep convolutional model to proof its effectiveness. 

The result shows that the model can reach the state-of-the-art performance at that time.
